# Swiss-Rainfall-Modelling
Modelling of Rainfall via GLMs

We use 2nd-order Markov chain generalised linear models to model the amount of rainfall at a location in Switzerland (not given to us!).

## Code

``Project 1.R`` contains the analysis code. ``prob1.R``, ``amount1.R`` and ``fun.R`` prepare the data (used within ``Project 1.R``).
